## **NWU Tech Trends Telemetry Portal: User Acceptance Testing Automation** ##

This project automates the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) for the NWU Tech Trends Telemetry Portal web application using UiPath. UAT is critical for ensuring that the web application behaves as expected when new records are created. The process is traditionally manual but has been automated in this project using Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to reduce repetitive tasks and improve accuracy. The bot reads input data from an Excel file, inputs it into the web application, checks if the record was created successfully, and logs the result.

Before running the project, ensure you have the following:

•	A UiPath Automation Cloud account.

•	UiPath Studio Community Edition installed.

•	Access to the web application.

•	The Excel file containing test input data.

# New users must register and log in before testing and they can try out the User Acceptance Testing Automation.
